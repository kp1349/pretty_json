# pretty_json
This python script goes through all the JSON files in a directory and correctly indents them into a sub-folder

Put the pretty.py file into a folder with .json files.

Run it:
```bash
python pretty.py
```

Open the new folder called "pretty_json". It now holds the same files, but now 'pretty'.
